# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##     - "Task name 1"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: |
  Fix the broken bidding system where bids placed by suppliers are not visible to either party. 
  Buyers need to see all bids submitted to their projects (with supplier name, bid amount, messages).
  Suppliers need a "My Bids" dashboard to track their placed bids and their status (pending, awarded, rejected).
  Also enhance Admin Panel with detailed views - clicking on user should show email, masked password, all projects posted, and all bids placed.
  Clicking on project or bid should show full details.

    message: "CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED: Both bid visibility endpoints were failing due to MongoDB ObjectID serialization errors. The issue was that GET /jobs/{job_id}/bids and GET /bids/my endpoints were not removing the '_id' field before JSON serialization, while admin endpoints were properly handling this. SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: Added ObjectID removal logic (bid_dict = {k: v for k, v in bid.items() if k != '_id'}) to both endpoints, matching the pattern used in admin endpoints. TESTING RESULTS: All backend bid functionality now working perfectly - buyers can see bids with supplier info, suppliers can see their bids with job info, admin endpoints working, authorization controls working, database persistence confirmed. Frontend integration should now work since backend APIs are returning proper data."
