The previous AI engineer successfully developed BuildBidz into a comprehensive B2B construction marketplace across three major iterations. The initial phase established a FastAPI backend with MongoDB and a React frontend utilizing Shadcn UI, integrating Razorpay for subscriptions. Key functionalities like authentication (Buyer/Supplier roles), job posting, and bidding were implemented. Subsequent updates focused on addressing user-reported issues, including refining the subscription model to monthly billing with a free trial, enhancing mobile UI, developing a fully functional admin panel, implementing password management, creating a user settings page, and adding an About Us page. A real-time chat system was also integrated. The engineer consistently followed a structured approach, utilizing bulk file writes for initial drops and targeted edits for fixes, with continuous testing. The most recent work involves refining the bidding system's visibility and enhancing the admin panel's detailed views for users, projects, and bids.

<product_requirements>
The BuildBidz application is designed as a two-sided B2B construction marketplace to connect construction companies (Buyers) with verified suppliers and contractors (Vendors).

Initial product requirements included:
*   A professional, dark-themed landing page with construction-industry imagery.
*   A robust authentication system supporting Buyer and Supplier roles, secured with JWT.
*   Integration with Razorpay for a subscription model, initially planned at ₹5,000/year for Buyers.
*   Role-based dashboards providing relevant analytics and quick actions.
*   Core marketplace features: job posting (gated by subscription for Buyers), job browsing, and a bidding system for Suppliers, including bid comparison and awarding tools.

Subsequent enhancements and bug fixes were requested:
*   Correction of the subscription model to ₹5,000 per month with a 1-month free trial for new Buyers.
*   Implementation of a logout button visible on mobile interfaces.
*   Development of a comprehensive Admin Interface (accessible via  / ) allowing for viewing, managing, and deleting users, projects, and bids with real-time updates.
*   Addition of Forgot Password and Change Password functionalities.
*   Creation of a User Settings page for updating profile details.
*   Correction and consistent application of contact information (, ) across the platform.
*   Creation of a dedicated About Us page with specified content and navigation.
*   Enhancements to the bidding system for bid awarding, notifications, and clearer UI status.
*   Integration of a real-time, in-app chat system for Buyer↔Supplier, Buyer↔Admin, and Supplier↔Admin communication, with optional file sharing.

The current focus is on fixing the visibility of bids to both buyers and suppliers and implementing detailed views for users, projects, and bids within the Admin Panel.

<code_architecture>
The BuildBidz application is structured as a full-stack web application with a clear separation of concerns between its frontend, backend, and testing components.

**Detailed Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Their Importance:**
*   : This is the central hub of the backend. It defines all REST API endpoints for user authentication (registration, login, password management), CRUD operations for jobs and bids, Razorpay payment processing, admin functionalities (listing/deleting users, jobs, bids), and the real-time chat system using WebSockets. It interacts directly with MongoDB to persist data and enforces application logic and security. Significant changes were made to add new routes, implement business logic for subscriptions, enhance admin views, and fix MongoDB  serialization.
*   : Critical for environment-specific configurations. It stores  for database connection, , and sensitive Razorpay API credentials (, ). It was updated to include the Razorpay keys.
*   : The primary React component managing the application's single-page routing using . It orchestrates the rendering of different pages (, , , etc.) based on the URL and user authentication state. It was frequently updated to integrate new pages and components.
*    & : These files define the global and component-level styling, enforcing the dark professional theme and UI/UX guidelines (e.g., spacing, glass-morphism) using Tailwind CSS.
*   : The root HTML file where the React application is mounted. It was modified to include the Razorpay SDK script, which is essential for handling client-side payment operations.
*   : This directory contains all the modular React components that make up the user interface. These include  (updated for contact info, About Us link),  (registration/login forms),  (role-based views, mobile logout, notification bell),  (updated for monthly billing, contact info),  (newly created for admin control),  (updated for bid status and chat button), and  (newly created for real-time messaging). These files collectively manage user interactions and data presentation.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Admin User Detail View**: Implement a detailed view within the Admin Panel showing a user's email, masked password, all associated projects, and all bids.
-   **Admin Access to Bid & Project Details**: Enhance the Admin Panel to display full requirements for projects and comprehensive details for bids (amount, supplier, messages/files).
-   **Fix Broken Bidding System**: Ensure bids are visible to buyers on their project pages and create a My Bids dashboard for suppliers to track their placed bids, their status, and related project details.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a new set of critical enhancements and bug fixes for the BuildBidz platform. The core focus is on rectifying issues within the bidding system's visibility and augmenting the Admin Panel with more granular detail views.

The current work revolves around two primary areas:
1.  **Rectifying the Broken Bidding System**: The user explicitly stated that bids placed by suppliers are not visible to either party. The task requires fixing this to ensure buyers can see all bids submitted to their projects, including the supplier's name, bid amount, and any accompanying messages. Concurrently, suppliers need a dedicated My Bids dashboard that displays their placed bids, their current status (e.g., pending, awarded, rejected), and relevant project details for each bid. The AI engineer's last action confirms an investigation into the  and  to identify the root cause of the current visibility issues and plan the necessary logic and UI updates.
2.  **Enhancing Admin Detail Views**: The engineer is also tasked with improving the Admin Panel's capabilities by implementing detailed views. This involves allowing the admin to click on a specific user to view their email, (preferably masked) password, and a comprehensive list of all projects they have posted and bids they have placed. Similarly, clicking on a project or a bid should reveal its full details, including project requirements, bid amount, supplier information, and any attached messages or files. The engineer has identified that the necessary backend endpoints for bidding exist and is now planning to enhance them for these detailed admin views, alongside creating the corresponding frontend components.

The precise state of work is that the engineer has just completed checking the  file (frontend) and the  file (backend) to understand the current implementation of the bidding system, specifically to diagnose why bids are not visible as expected. The next step involves implementing the identified fixes for the bidding system and then proceeding with the creation of the enhanced admin components for detailed views.
