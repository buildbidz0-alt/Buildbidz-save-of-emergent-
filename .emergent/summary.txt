The AI engineer successfully progressed the BuildBidz application through several iterations. Initially, the focus was on fixing bid visibility and enhancing the Admin Panel. A significant issue regarding Made with Emergent branding was identified and promptly removed. Subsequently, the engineer systematically addressed a comprehensive list of 11 user-reported bugs and feature requests, ranging from critical messaging system malfunctions and buyer dashboard issues to implementing a full Salesman role with its dedicated dashboard, file upload capabilities, mandatory GST/address requirements, and crucial SEO/UI improvements. Repeatedly,  serialization errors were a root cause of issues, which the engineer diligently fixed. The engineer consistently utilized testing agents to validate fixes and new features, although some frontend integration issues surfaced post-backend fixes. The trajectory concludes with the engineer actively debugging and fixing role-based file visibility, specifically within backend file access endpoints.

<product_requirements>
The BuildBidz application is a B2B construction marketplace connecting Buyers with Suppliers/Vendors.
**Core Features**: User authentication (Buyer/Supplier/Salesman roles), JWT security, Razorpay subscriptions (₹5,000/month, 1-month trial), role-based dashboards, job posting (subscription-gated), job browsing, bidding system (comparison, awarding, salesman bids on behalf of unregistered companies), real-time chat (Buyer↔Supplier/Admin, Supplier↔Admin).
**Key Enhancements/Fixes**: Mobile UI improvements (logout, notification bell), comprehensive Admin Panel (manage users, jobs, bids with detailed views), password management, user settings, About Us page, consistent contact info (, ), SEO (favicon, meta/Open Graph tags), updated statistics (, ), image and file upload for job posts/bids, mandatory GST registration and business address for users and salesman bids, and robust chat history persistence.
**Current Problem**: Files uploaded by buyers/sellers are not visible to all intended recipients (e.g., buyer files not to salesmen/sellers; bid files not to buyers/salesmen/admin), due to restrictive role-based access.

-   **File Visibility Based on User Roles (Download Endpoint)**: The last action in the trajectory indicates that the AI engineer needs to update the file download endpoint to ensure it correctly applies the new role-based access controls for job and bid files.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a user-reported bug concerning File Visibility Based on User Roles. The problem was that files uploaded by a buyer were visible to the admin but not to salesmen or other sellers, and similarly, files uploaded by a seller (bid files) were not visible to the buyer, salesman, or admin. This indicates a failure in role-based access control for file viewing.

The AI engineer's investigation focused on the backend  file, specifically the file access endpoints (). The root cause was identified as overly restrictive authorization logic. For instance, suppliers could only view job files *after* placing a bid, preventing them from accessing crucial information necessary to formulate a bid.

To rectify this, the AI engineer has already made the following critical changes in :
1.  **Modified Job File Access**: The authorization logic for retrieving job files (e.g., ) was updated to allow potential bidders (suppliers and salesmen) to view files *before* submitting a bid, ensuring they have the necessary context.
2.  **Modified Bid File Access**: The authorization logic for retrieving bid files () was also updated to ensure proper role-based access, making them visible to buyers, salesmen, and admins.

The current state of work is that the AI engineer has successfully adjusted the authorization for viewing files, and the next step is to extend these updated role-based access controls to the *file download endpoint* to ensure consistency.
